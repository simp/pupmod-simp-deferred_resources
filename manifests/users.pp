# This class takes an Array of user resources to remove, and a Hash of user
# resources to install.
#
# After the entire puppet catalog has been compiled, it will process both lists
# and, for any resource that is not already defined in the catalog, it will
# take the appropriate action.
#
# An exception will be raised if you list the same user in both lists.
#
# @param remove
#   A list of users to remove.
#
# @param install
#   A list of users to install.
#
#   * A `Hash` can be used to add extra attributes for the user, but the
#     `ensure` attribute will always be set to `absent` for removal and
#     `present` for creation.
#
# @param mode
#   @see `deferred_resources::mode`
#
# @param log_level
#   @see `deferred_resources::log_level`
