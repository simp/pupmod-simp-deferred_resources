## Description

This module provides capabilities to add resources to the puppet catalog
**after** the initial compilation has been compiled.

**WARNING:** This module is not recommended for use outside of the SIMP
framework. It was developed for specific policy requirements from the DISA
STIG, CIS Benchmark, etc... that require packages to either be installed or
removed.  In order to not interfere with other manifests that might have
legitimately added package resources, it first checks if each resource has
already been included in the catalog and then adds the appropriate resource
to install or remove that resource, as necessary.

### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://simp-project.com),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they may be submitted to our [bug
tracker](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).


This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but
it can be used independently:

 * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will
   be managed from the Puppet server.
 * If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by
   default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review
   the parameters in
   [`simp/simp_options`](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp_options) for
   details.

## Usage

This module provides classes that help users properly use the underlying native
type for processing deferred resources.

### Example: Managing Packages

```
  class { 'deferred_resources::package':
    'remove'  => ['pkg1', 'pkg2'],
    'install' => ['pkg3', 'pkg4'],
    'mode'    => 'enforcing'
  }
```

### Example: Managing Packages but silencing messages

```
  class { 'deferred_resources::package':
    'remove'    => ['pkg1', 'pkg2'],
    'install'   => ['pkg3', 'pkg4'],
    'mode'      => 'enforcing',
    'log_level' => 'debug'
  }
```

## Reference

Please refer to the inline documentation within each source file, or to the
module's generated YARD documentation for reference material.

## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the
[`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of
supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.

## Development


Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simpdoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).

### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance
tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).
By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox
must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the
tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```


Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.
